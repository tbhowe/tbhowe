I have a PhD in neuroscience, with a focus on learning and memory in the Hippocampus. I'm now working as a Data Scientist and curriculum designer for AiCore. I am interested in all aspects of data science, with a particular focus on time-series analysis, leveraging techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to solve business problems.
